# esprima-ast-utils [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/llafuente/esprima-ast-utils.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/llafuente/esprima-ast-utils)

Node module to manipulate, transform, query and debug [esprima](https://github.com/ariya/esprima) ASTs.

## Objective

When you edit esprima AST and go back to code with escodegen you lose too much information because primary you don't keep track of ranges, tokens, comments etc.
esprima-ast-utils do this for you, so no escodegen is needed, you can edit the AST directly and code everything is in sync.
